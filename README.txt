README:
The following are the functions of the python files present:
1. calc_padel.py: calculates the padel descriptors for natural and synthetic compounds, stored in CSVs.
2. gaussian_naive_bayes.py: Gaussian Naive Bayes model.
3. mlp_and_logistic_regression.py: MLP and Logistic Regression models.
4. preliminary_decision_tree_full_dataset.py: testing decision trees and storing in pickle files for depths 1-25.
5. preliminary_random_forest_full_dataset.py: testing random forests and storing in pickle files for depths 1-45.
6. test_model.py: confirms pickle models are loaded by testing the accuracy for a decision tree of depth 9.
7. test_model_all_decision_tree_15.py: tests decision tree models for depths up to 15.
8. test_model_all_random_forest_36.py: tests random forest models for depths up to 36.
